# zoo
project 2

Brief: 
You have been asked to create a zoo management app so that we can manage our animals. The user must be able to add enclosures, add / remove animals, feed animals and anything else you can dream up!

Additionally:
Animals cannot be placed in the same enclosure if they would eat one and other.
Animals can be sold.
View the total income for the zoo.
Animals can randomly go on a rampage and break out of their enclosures

Installation and running instructions:
Although intended as a Java project, the project was built in Android Studio, and has a simple Android app to show some features. To run tests and and use the app, clone the project and open in Android Studio.
